This predictive analytics project explores two key datasets: a synthetic time series of TV advertising and sales, and a real-world cross-sectional dataset on heart disease. For the time series data, techniques like EMA smoothing, ARMA modeling, ADF tests, and a VECM model were used to analyze trends and quantify the long-term impact of advertising on sales. For the heart disease dataset, classification methods (logistic regression and random forest) and clustering techniques (K-Means and hierarchical clustering) were applied to uncover patterns in patient health data, achieving up to 90% accuracy in disease prediction. Together, these analyses demonstrate how statistical modeling and machine learning can support actionable insights in both business and healthcare contexts.
